# Agumented model

1. Perron's test - the test for stationary series with structural changes. 
2. if the residulas are not normally distributed, then we should add more laggs to the model.
3. residuals look good and what is the next step- tstat for a1 = 1. and compare the critical values of the perrons tests.
4. the p test stats is the f(lamda). for example if the lamda is 0.5%, then the 5% of the critical value 15 - 3.76.
5. you reject the null.
6. if the t stat is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.
7. in r there is a perrons tests that can be used. what is the fuction for that btw?
8. lamda is the coeeficient of the perrons test.
9. 0.5yt-1 is an Ar and anything with the coefficient 1 is a random walk.
10. the BN decompesition is used to filter the stochastiv trend from a time series. the limitation is that this is a univariate filter.
11.
